# StockProjectCL
Prototype command line application 

Weclome to StockProjectCL. This is a prototype command line application, designed to be a proof of concept for a website version of this application. 

I have decided to essentially split StockProject into two in order to focus on one thing at a time. The first thing that I want to focus on is to create an application that interacts the Polygon.io API. However this is done e.g. Swing application, command Lline or even a website, I figure that the command line is a good place to start, just to get backend logic working! The second thing that I wish to do with StockProject, is to give this backend code a face in the form of a website!

So first things first!
